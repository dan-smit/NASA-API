Javascript was used to interact with a NASA API in order to display a space image and explanation. 

## Optimizations

One way to optimize this project would be to design a date input that provides a better user interface and is more visually appealing by using tools such as jQuery.

## Lessons Learned

I learned how to work with date input, but learned that date input styles cannot be manipulated with CSS. I could learn tools such as jQuery to provide the user with a better experience.
